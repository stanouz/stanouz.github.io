We leave town with about two to three days of food dispersed between frame bags and seat packs. 
This nearly fills my bags unless we choose foods which pack more efficiently. Included are two 
loaves of bread from the bakery, nearly a kilo of feta, olives, two packs of sausages, orzo, 
some vegetables, and dried fruits and nuts. I drain a big bottle of wine into the Klean Kanteen.

Cooking alcohol is available everywhere in Greece, used to fuel small candles at religious 
monuments and memorials by the roadside and in homes.
