Beach Days

Cycling through Greece was an unforgettable adventure, a journey that blended breathtaking landscapes, ancient history, and warm hospitality. Starting in Athens, I pedaled past centuries of history, the Acropolis standing tall as a reminder of Greece's illustrious past. Navigating the bustling streets gave way to quieter roads as I made my way toward the countryside.  

The Peloponnese region was a highlight, with its rolling hills, olive groves, and crystal-clear coastal views. My ride along the Aegean coast was surreal, the gentle sea breeze and vibrant blues of the water providing the perfect backdrop. I stopped frequently—not just to rest but to soak in the sights and savor the local delicacies. Freshly made tzatziki, feta cheese, and warm pita became staples of my meals.  

One of the most memorable days was cycling up to the mountain villages of Arcadia. It was challenging, but the reward of sweeping panoramas and a quiet evening in a cozy, family-run taverna made every uphill moment worth it. From there, I explored ancient sites like Mycenae and Epidaurus, imagining the myths and stories that shaped these ruins.  

Crossing over to the islands brought a different kind of magic. I ferried to Crete, where rugged landscapes and charming coastal villages felt worlds apart. Riding through Samaria Gorge was a test of endurance, but the sheer beauty of the towering cliffs left me awestruck.  

The trip wasn't without its challenges—flat tires, unpredictable weather, and the occasional wrong turn tested my patience. Yet, every moment felt like a part of the adventure, even when I had to push my bike up a particularly steep trail.  

As the trip wound down, I found myself reflecting on the simplicity of bikepacking: the rhythm of pedaling, the freedom of stopping wherever curiosity led me, and the connections with people along the way. Greece, with its blend of ancient and modern, rugged and serene, had left an indelible mark on me.  

I’ll always remember the beauty of riding at sunrise along the coast, the friendly faces of strangers offering a helping hand, and the pure joy of exploring a place so deeply connected to its roots. Bikepacking through Greece wasn't just a journey across a country; it was a journey into its soul—and perhaps, a bit into my own.
